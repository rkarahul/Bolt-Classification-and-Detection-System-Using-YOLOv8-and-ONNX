# Bolt-Classification-and-Detection-System-Using-YOLOv8-and-ONNX
This project detects and classifies bolts as "NORM" or "TVS" using YOLOv8 and ONNX models, with majority voting for accuracy. It runs via a FastAPI endpoint, processes base64 images, and outputs bolt count, labels, and status, supporting CPU inference and quality control.
